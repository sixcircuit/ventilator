## The Project

This repository contains the designs for a ventilator and ventilator valves.

You can build it for $50 at scale out of parts you can find any large hardware store.

You can control pressure, volume, respiration rate, I:E ratio, and PEEP. It will accept oxygen.

You can build 1000 a day, every day, in any city on earth, with parts you have on hand, starting today.

This repository also contains designs for the patient valve, and check valves that are integral to the design and functioning of a ventilator. They may be the most valuable part of this project. You can build them for $3 out of hardware store parts.

The videos below will walk you though the concepts and the design of the device.

## If you have feedback

If you have design feedback, if you think I missed a nuance of physiology or ventilation or physics or engineering -- I want to hear from you. Please [contact me](https://forms.gle/BKPWRyAayMz9HJRt8). We can make this better together.
<br/><br/>

## If I can help you

If you want to build one of these or 100 or 1000 or a country full, I want to help. Please [contact me](https://forms.gle/BKPWRyAayMz9HJRt8).
